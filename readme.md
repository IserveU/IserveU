## Contributing

##### Talk

We're a volunteer group and although we mostly PM each other inappropriate jokes we're happy to help new people get started as a contributor over on [Gitter ![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/IserveU/IserveU.svg)](https://gitter.im/IserveU/IserveU?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

##### Test
Like TDD? We test a lot so you'll want to checkout the
[section we wrote on testing](https://github.com/IserveU/IserveU/wiki/Testing) to get rolling.

##### Tool
The API we use is RESTful and uses nested routes so we've got some documentation on it here
